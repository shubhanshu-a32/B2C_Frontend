                                The Ketalog Platform is a technology-enabled multi-category e-commerce
                                marketplace that allows users and consumers to place orders for
                                products offered by independent sellers, shopkeepers, and service
                                providers through the Platform. Products and services available on the
                                Platform may be listed or offered for sale by Ketalog, its affiliates,
                                or independent third-party sellers and vendors (collectively referred
                                to as “Third Party Sellers”). Ketalog does not own, manufacture, or
                                store inventory for such products and operates solely as a facilitator
                                providing digital infrastructure to enable transactions between users
                                and Third Party Sellers, except where explicitly stated otherwise.

                                When a user places an order on the Ketalog Platform, the order details
                                are electronically transmitted to the relevant Third Party Seller or
                                shopkeeper for processing and fulfillment. The Third Party Seller
                                prepares the order, after which an independent delivery partner
                                collects the product(s) from the seller’s premises and delivers them
                                to the customer at the designated delivery address. For abundant
                                clarity, Ketalog does not store, warehouse, package, or physically
                                handle products listed on the Platform and does not participate in the
                                fulfillment process beyond facilitating order placement,
                                communication, and logistics coordination through the Platform.

                                such transaction being a direct and independent arrangement between
                                the user and the seller. Ketalog does not exercise control over, nor

                                As part of its current operational model, Ketalog does not charge
                                delivery partners any registration fees, commission, platform fees, or
                                additional charges for availing or providing delivery services through
                                the Platform. Ketalog compensates delivery partners in accordance with
                                mutually agreed terms, based on delivery parameters such as distance,
                                time, or order requirements, as determined from time to time. Users
                                are expected to treat all delivery partners with dignity, courtesy,
                                and respect and to support a safe, harassment-free working
                                environment. Any discourteous, abusive, unlawful, or inappropriate
                                behavior toward a delivery partner may result in suspension or
                                termination of user access to the Platform at Ketalog’s sole
                                discretion. Any claims, damages, or compensation arising due to a
                                user’s misconduct toward a delivery partner shall be the sole
                                responsibility of the user, and Ketalog shall not bear any liability
                                in this regard.
